APILayer

This plugin utilizes a third-party service, APILayer (https://apilayer.com/), to get updated currency rates. When the plugin needs to calculate currency wise price, it retrieves updated currency rates. For example, we need convert currency from usd to ero, then it will retrieve currency rate and help to convert the price to ero.
